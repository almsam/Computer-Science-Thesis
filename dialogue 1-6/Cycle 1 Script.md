Player is alone except for an owl, 

**First Mission: Talk to Owl**

Dialogue options with Owl:

| Owl: Hello there\! Need any help? |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Beaver**: What happened here? |  | Beaver: Hi, Got any food? |
| **Owl**: You must be new here. It’s wildfire season, it happens every year\! |  | Owl: Not for your kind, I don’t. I saw a small patch of willow just North of here, not much but it should get you through the day. |
| **Beaver**: Aren’t fires dangerous? | **Beaver**: You sound excited? | Beaver: What happened here? |
| **Owl**: Not usually, fire is a part of the ecosystem in the Okanagan. | **Owl**: Oh yeah\! If you stick around long enough, you’ll see how the land will flourish after the fire has passed.  |  |
| **Owl**: It cleanses the land by removing dead material like decaying wood, leaf litter, and dry grasses so that new growth can happen | **Owl**: In fact, some plants actually need fire for their seeds to start growing. Like Lodgepole pine. Their cones *only* release seeds when heated by flames. |  |
| **Beave**r: But it's so ugly… | **Beaver**: Won’t we get hurt? |  |
| **Owl**: Don’t worry about that. If you stick around long enough you’ll see how the land will flourish after the fire has passed. In fact, some plants, such as Lodgepole pine, actually require fire for their seeds to disperse. | **Owl**: You might… but we need fire\! Fire cleanses the land by removing dead material like decaying wood, leaf litter, and dry grasses so that new growth can happen. |  |
| **Beaver:** Hmm…ok |  |  |
| **Owl:** But you know what’s really risky? When the land is too dry. That’s when fire gets out of control.  |  |  |
| **Owl:** What we need is more moisture in the soil. We need something that can slow down the water and let it soak into the ground.  |  |  |
| **Beaver:** Hmm…yeah…something like a dam\! |  |  |
| **Owl:** Yes\! A dam would be perfect for that\! |  |  |
| **Owl:** But before you build that, it's best you get a lay of the land. |  |  |
| **Owl:** Talk to other animals to find out more about the land, and complete missions to gain knowledge points. |  |  |

**Mission**: Engineering 101 \- Build a dam

Beavers build dams to stem the flow of water in streams, creating deep ponds where we can build lodges, store food, and hide from large predators. To build your first dam, you’ll have to:

**Objectives**: 

* Select your preferred dam location at the crafting station  
* Gather the required materials to build your dam  
* Build your dam at the crafting station

Feedback when collecting items:

* Dams restrict the flow of water in streams, allowing water to be absorbed by nearby soil  
* Complete your mission before the cycle ends

---

**After player completes mission:**

| Owl: I’m impressed\! By building this dam, you’ve blocked the stream enough to create a pond. This allows water to spread across the land, recharging our groundwater supply and supporting our plants\! |
| :---- |
| **Owl**: We could really use someone like you around here. Think you’ll stick around for a while? |
| **Beaver:** I think so. |
| **Owl**: Great, make yourself at home \- you’ve earned it\! |

This unlocks the lodge building mission in the next cycle

**Mission**: Field Notes \- The Okanagan

Your encyclopedia is filled with field notes, but no images\! Explore the land and take pictures to complete the entries.

**Objectives**: 

* Find evidence of 4 features of semi-arid climates   
* Take a photo of each one  
* Match each photo to its description in your encyclopedia

**Reward**: 

* 1 knowledge point


| Description | Item(s) |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Climate**: A key characteristic of this region is that there is limited precipitation. Low rainfall and snowfall mean that when temperatures increase, groundwater levels reduce and soil dries out.  | Dry, cracked soil  Dead fish Dry yellow vegetation Muddy water |
| **Vegetation**: The Okanagan region has diverse vegetation, including forests, grasslands, and shrublands. Common species include Saskatoon berries, Reed Canary grass, and Douglas Fir, amongst others. | Saskatoon Reed Canary Grass Douglas Fir |
| **Adaptation**: Plants in this region have adapted to survive during hot-dry summers and mild winters. Native plants such as Red-Osier Dogwood are extremely drought-tolerant, while others, such as Lodgepole pine, need fire to disperse their seeds. | Red-Osier Dogwood Lodgepole pine |
| **Ecosystem Services:** Fire is a natural part of the ecosystem in this region and clears the land of dead material like decaying wood and leaf litter. Many trees are protected from these fires by their thick bark. | Burnt tree bark Dry leaves on the ground |
