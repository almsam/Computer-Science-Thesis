**If player did not complete Engineering 101 or Find a way to slow the stream missions in the previous cycle(s) trigger the following dialogue with Owl**

| Owl: This drought is terrible\! I thought you said you could help us… |
| :---- |
| **Beaver:** I’m trying |

| **Owl:** But I believe in you. You’ve got this\! |

**Include any missions missed**

| Deer: Hey you\! I’ve got a bone to pick with you\! |  |  |  |  |  |
| :---- | ----- | :---- | :---- | ----- | ----- |
| **Beaver**: Is there a problem? |  | **Beaver**: How can I help you? |  |  |  |
| **Deer:** Have you noticed anything about the grass? Or the shrubs and trees? |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Beaver**: Not really |  |  | **Beaver**: They look a little dry |  |  |
| **Deer**: Are you kidding? They’re *crispy*\! We live in semi-arid shrubland, not a desert\! We barely get any rain as it is—and now the plants are shriveling like it’s the apocalypse\! |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Beaver:** Wait, we don’t get rain? |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Deer:** Not much\! Maybe 300mm a year.  That’s why water’s so precious around here. That’s why your dams and canals matter. That’s why you’re supposed to be helping trap water and slow it down. |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Deer**: What kind of ecosystem engineer are you? |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Beaver:** Ecosystem engineer? What’s that? |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Deer**: You’ve got to be joking\! Ecosystem engineer? Your official title\! Through your actions, you create, modify, and maintain our habitats. |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Beaver**: Since when? |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Deer**: Look, buddy, ask around. The other keystone species will tell you all about it\! |  |  |  |  |  |
| **Deer**: And the next time I see you I expect my grass to be *moist.* You hear me? *MOIST*\! |  |  |  |  |  |

**Missions**: 

* What are keystone species?:   
  Speak to other keystone species to find out about keystone species  
* Speak to a mutualist  
* Speak to a predator  
* Answer questions to complete your encyclopedia entry on keystone species

Reward: 3 knowledge points

* I like my grass moist   
  Irrigate the land by digging another canal. Areas not irrigated by canals will be more susceptible to wildfire.  
* Adding an additional canal requires 1 knowledge point  
* Digging a canal for the first time requires 3 knowledge points

**Bees \- ⅓ Knowledge point**

| Beaver: Are you a mutualist? |  | Beaver: Are you a predator? |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Bees:** Why yes\! Yes, we are. |  | **Bees:** lol no, we’re mutualists |
| **Beaver**: And what exactly is that? |  | **Beaver**: And what exactly is that? |
| **Bees:** A mutualist is an organism that is involved in a symbiotic relationship, more specifically a mutualistic relationship. |  |  |
| **Bees:** In this type of relationship both organisms benefit from interacting. Bees are pollinators and are in a mutualistic relationship with flowering plants. |  |  |
| **Beaver**: That reminds me of a joke I heard once: What did the bee say to the flower? | **Beaver**: And what are keystone species? |  |
| **Bees:** What? |  |  |
| **Beaver**: Helloooo Honey\! |  |  |
| **Bees:** I don’t get it. |  |  |
| **Beaver:** Never mind. What are keystone species? |  |  |
| **Bees:** A keystone species is any species that has a large effect on its natural environment relative to its abundance.  |  |  |
| **Bees**: Like bees; although we’re small in size and population, without our ability to pollinate flowering plants, an ecosystem could potentially collapse. |  |  |
| **Bees**: other keystone species include predators and ecosystem engineers like you\! |  |  |

**Coyote \- ⅓ Knowledge point**

| Beaver: Are you a predator |  | Beaver: Are you a mutualist |
| :---- | ----- | :---- |
| **Coyote:** Obviously |  | **Bees:** Do I look like a mutualist to you? |
| **Beaver**: My parents warned me about those.. |  | **Beaver**: So you must be a predator |
| **Coyote:** Did your parents also tell you about how vital we are for an ecosystem? |  | **Beaver**: My parents warned me about those.. |
| **Beaver:** Not really. |  |  |
| **Coyote:** Typical. Predators help to regulate prey population; you know deer, moose, rabbits.., |  |  |
| **Coyote:** Without us, their population would grow to unsustainable numbers, putting pressure on lower levels of the trophic web. |  |  |
| **Coyote:** So you can thank us for giving you enough grass to eat, or whatever it is your kind likes. |  |  |
| **Beaver:** Speaking of grass, do you take requests? |  |  |

**Turtle \- ⅓ Knowledge point**

| Beaver: Are you a mutualist? |  | Beaver: Are you a predator? |
| :---- | ----- | :---- |
| **Turtle:** Now why would you think that? |  | **Turtle:** Are you making fun of me? |

**Salmon \- 0 Knowledge points**

| Beaver: Are you a mutualist? |  | Beaver: Are you a predator? |
| :---- | ----- | :---- |
| **Salmon:** No, trying talking to the bees |  | **Salmon:** Not really |
