**If player did not complete Engineering 101, Find a way to slow the stream, AND/OR I like my grass moist**  **missions in the previous cycle(s) trigger the following dialogue with Owl instead of cutscene A**

**Cutscene**

Aerial shot of the terrain downstream of the beaver dam; the grass is burnt and the bark on some trees is charred. The camera moves upstream to the player where the nearby trees and shrubs are untouched.

Owl flies down to meet the player by the dam

| Owl: This is bad, a wildfire could start at any moment and cause some serious damage.This wetland is FAR from wet. |
| :---- |
| **Beaver:** I’m trying |
| **Owl:** You have to act fast\! We’re all depending on you. |

Owl flies down to meet the player by the dam

| Owl: What a difference\! |
| :---- |
| **Beaver:** Yeah, it’s coming together. |
| **Owl:** Why don’t you take a look around? You’ll see just how important you are to holding this whole ecosystem together. |

**Mission:** Field analysis (Only available if the player has built their dam)  
Collect field data on vegetation, soil, and water conditions both upstream and downstream of your dam. 

* Go to the marked areas on your map.  
* Take a picture of any fire-related cues you observe and tag them with the appropriate caption  
  * *Hint*: Nearby animals can tell you more about what has happened in the area.


Reward: 2 knowledge points

**Field analysis continued:**

**Location A \- low intensity fire zone (recent) (upstream of dam, near one of the canals)**

| Item | Description | Correct caption |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Blackened tree trunks | 3 trees (Aspen and  Birch) with the bark on their lower trunk blackened | Deciduous trees like Aspen and Birch are generally more fire-resistant and may act as “natural fuel breaks” as they retain more moisture. Ponderosa pine as well |
| Ash layer on soil | A layer of grey ash lies on the surface of the forest floor | Nutrients from leaf litter has been released back into the soil |
| A fallen tree branch | A large branch fallen to the ground | N/A (false answer) |
| Is this a: Historical fire zone No fire zone Recent fire zone |  | Recent fire zone |

**Dialogue with Moose**

| Beaver: What happened here? |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Moose:** This is what the land looks like after a low intensity fire, or surface fire. |  |
| **Beaver:** What's a surface fire? | **Beaver:** What makes it low intensity? |
| **Moose:**  A surface fire is a type of wildfire of low to moderate intensity that burns only the forest floor. Meaning that it will only consume leaf litter, grasses, low shrubs, fallen branches, and small seedlings but will not typically reach the tree canopy. | **Moose:** A low-intensity fire is one that burns at a low temperature and spreads slowly. It causes minimal damage to mature vegetation like trees but clears the forest floor of fuel like leaf litter, grasses, low shrubs, fallen branches, and small seedlings. The fuel also tends to be moist which limits the flame height **.** |
| **Beaver:** Is that good or bad? |  |
| **Moose:** It's good\! In areas with frequent fires, fuel loads are kept low, which naturally limits fire intensity. |  |
| **Moose:** In fact, for thousands of years, Indigenous peoples conducted cultural burns to manage the land, and the ash from burned fuels releases nutrients back into the soil. |  |

**Location B \- historical fire zone (previous years) (upstream of dam, away from dam)**

| Item | Description | Correct caption |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Open forest structure | Open forest structure with spaced out trees more deciduous trees Ponderosa pine | Regular low intensity fires help prevent overcrowding in forests |
| Meadow | A meadow with trees at the periphery | Fires maintains grasslands by exposing the soil to light and warmth, stimulating new growth. |
| A rock | A large rock in the meadow | N/A (false answer) |
| Is this a: Historical fire zone No fire zone Recent fire zone |  | Historical fire zone |

**Dialogue with Turtle (turtle is on the rock)**

| Beaver: What happened here? |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Turtle:** Every few years a fire comes through this area and clears the land. It’s why the trees here are so spaced out, and why the meadow here is so lush. |  |
| **Beaver:** How does fire space out trees? | **Beaver:** How does fire make meadows lush? |
| **Turtle:**  Fire removes smaller, weaker vegetation like saplings and thins the forest out by reducing competition. | **Turtle:** Fire burns away dry grass and debris that can smother new growth. By clearing away old grass fire allows sunlight and warmth to reach the soil so that fresh shoots and wildflowers can emerge. |
| **Beaver:** What about this rock? |  |
| **Turtle:** What about it? |  |
| **Beaver:** Did fire create this rock? |  |
| **Turtle:** No. It's literally just a rock. |  |

**Location C \- No fire zone (most upstream from dam, away from dam)**

| Item | Description | Correct caption |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| Closed canopy | Closed canopy (mix of deciduous and coniferous trees) with little sunlight on the forest floor thin and tall plants, lack of nutrition sensitive to pests | Without regular fires and thinning of forests, tree canopies grow dense  |
| Conifers in meadow | 5 conifers (Douglas Fir, Ponderosa Pine) in what is largely a meadowy area less grasses on the ground | Coniferous trees like Douglas Fir and Ponderosa Pine are known to be highly flammable due to their needles which contain resin and oils that ignite quickly. |
| Is this a: Historical fire zone No fire zone Recent fire zone |  | No fire zone |

**Dialogue with Woodpecker**

| Beaver: What happened here? |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Woodpecker:** Nothing. This area hasn’t been exposed to fire in a dangerously long time. |  |
| **Beaver:** Why is it dangerous? | **Beaver:** What will happen if this area is exposed to fire? |
| **Woodpecker:** Without regular fire, all the dry grasses, dead branches, and small trees build up. The perfect fuel for a megafire. | **Woodpecker:** When fire is gone for too long, things get out of balance. Without regular fire, all the dry grasses, dead branches, and small trees build up. The perfect fuel for a megafire. |

After captioning all the photos, the player should return to Owl for analysis.

* If the player gets all captions correct they will receive 2 knowledge point and the following dialogue appears:

**Owl:** Now you can understand why your dam and canals are so important in regulating fires on the land. Beaver made structures allow water to remain on the land longer. When our soil and vegetation is moist it makes our land more fire resilient. Now when wildfires pass through the land, they will be less intense.

* If the player does not get all captions correct they will get one more chance at captioning each photo correctly. If they are wrong again Owl reveals the correct  captions for each photo.

**Owl:** Your observations aren’t quite correct, why don’t you try one more time?

**Owl:** Your field analysis wasn't quite right, but that's alright\! Allow me to correct:\[Correct images and captions\]

Now you can understand why your dam is so important in regulating fires on the land. By building this dam, you’ve blocked the stream enough to create a pond. This allows water to spread across the land, recharging our groundwater supply and supporting our plants\! Now when wildfires pass through the land, they will be less intense.

**Owl:** One of the zones you visited is in desperate need of your attention, a wildfire could strike at any moment and cause some serious damage. You’ll have to act fast\!

**Depending on the number of canals the player has dug the wildfire will occur within:**

2 canals \- 6 minutes  
1 canal \- 4 minutes

**Mission:** Fighting Fire 

* Identify area most at risk of fire within your territory  
* Cut down trees that are more flammable but leave trees that are more fire-resistant

**Success**: The player will only cut down the 5 conifers and will receive \- 2 knowledge points  
**Failure**: The player will cut down conifers and deciduous trees or will not cut down all of the conifers. The wildfire will burn this area severely \- producers health will decrease by 25 points
