This cycle is an opportunity for the player to catch up on previous missions before the game ends. 

**If player did not complete Engineering 101, Find a way to slow the stream, AND I like my grass moist**  **missions in the previous cycle(s) trigger the following dialogue with Owl**

| Owl: This is serious. Without a dam to slow the stream or a canal to guide the water, the soil has dried out and become so hard that it can’t absorb anything.  |
| :---- |
| **Owl:** Now, when the rain comes, the water will just run off the land which could lead to flooding. I was really hoping for better.  |
| **Beaver:** I’m trying |
| **Owl:** That's what you said last time… |

**If player did not complete Find a way to slow the stream, AND I like my grass moist**  **missions in the previous cycle(s) trigger the following dialogue with Owl**

| Owl: We still need to find a way to divert the stream AND irrigate the soil before the rain comes. Surely there’s something you can do? |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Beaver:** Dig a canal | **Beaver:** Build a dam |
| **Owl:** Alright, we’re depending on you\! |  |
