**If player did not complete dam building mission in the previous cycle trigger the following dialogue with Owl**

**Cutscene**

The player is chewing on some wood when Owl appears 

| Owl: I thought you said you were going to build a dam? |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Beaver:** I’m still working on it. |  |
| **Owl:** That's too bad, a dam would have allowed more water to spread across the land, preventing the wildfire from consuming too many plants.  |  |
| **Owl**: And what's worse is that heavy rains are forecasted over the next few days and you know what that will lead to… |  |
| **Beaver**: A rainbow | **Beaver**: A flood |
| **Owl**: I mean, yes…but more importantly flooding\! | **Owl**: Exactly\! |
| **Beaver**: I was just about to say that | **Owl**: Flooding isn't necessarily bad but a flood this soon after a fire is bad news, just ask anyone.. |
| **Owl**: Flooding isn't necessarily bad but a flood this soon after a fire is bad news, just ask anyone. |  |
| **Owl**: We need to find a way to reduce the stream's energy, if not it could cause a lot of damage for a bunch of animal folk. |  |
| **Owl:** Apart from building your dam what else can you do? |  |
| **Beaver:** Build another dam | **Beaver**: Dig a canal |
| **Owl:** Alright, good luck\! |  |

**Include this mission if player did not complete it in the first cycle**

**Mission**: Engineering 101 \- Build a dam

Beavers build dams to stem the flow of water in streams, creating deep ponds where we can build lodges, store food, and hide from large predators. To build your first dam, you’ll have to:

**Objectives**: 

* Select your preferred dam location at the crafting station  
* Gather the required materials to build your dam  
* Build your dam at the crafting station

Feedback when collecting items:

* Dams restrict the flow of water in streams, allowing water to be absorbed by nearby soil  
* Complete your mission before the cycle ends

**Cutcene**

The player is chewing on some wood when Owl appears 

| Owl: There you are\! I’ve been looking for you everywhere. |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Owl**: How can you be chewing wood at a time like this? |  |
| **Beaver**: What’s going on? |  |
| **Owl**: Didn’t you hear? Heavy rains are forecasted over the next few days and you know what that will lead to… |  |
| **Beaver**: A rainbow | **Beaver**: A flood |
| **Owl**: I mean, yes…but more importantly flooding\! | **Owl**: Exactly\! |
| **Beaver**: I was just about to say that | **Owl**: Flooding isn't necessarily bad but a flood this soon after a fire is bad news, just ask anyone.. |
| **Owl**: Flooding isn't necessarily bad but a flood this soon after a fire is bad news, just ask anyone. |  |
| **Owl**: We need to find a way to reduce the stream's energy, if not it could cause a lot of damage for a bunch of animal folk, including you\! |  |
| **Beaver**: Me? | **Beaver**: What do you mean? |
| **Owl**: Depending on the severity of the flood it could damage or destroy your dam, you’ll need to act fast if you don’t want to lose what you’ve already built\! |  |
| **Owl:** What will you do? |  |
| **Beaver:** Build another dam | **Beaver**: Dig a canal |
| **Owl:** Alright, good luck\! |  |

**Missions**:

* Build-A-Lodge  
  Your lodge is more than just a shelter — it keeps you safe from predators, shields you from the elements, and will one day be a home for your future kits.  
  * Gather the required materials to build your lodge  
  * Build your lodge at the crafting station  
      
* Why are floods worse after wildfires?  
  Find out why floods are worse after wildfires. 

*Objectives*: 

* Talk to different animals to find out.

	Reward: 2 knowledge points

* Find a way to slow the stream  
  * Dig a canal  
    * Requires: 3 knowledge points  
  * Build a support dam  
    * Requires 2 knowledge points

Dig a canal: The player digs a canal which diverts water, allowing it to move laterally across the flood plain, this will help in cycle 4 when another fire occurs

Build another dam: The player has the option to build a dam in the two locations they did not choose. Building a support dam does not help as much with diverting water to areas further from the stream. Depending on their choice the following will happen:

Primary dam A / Support dam B or C \- Dam A is destroyed by the flood and dams B or C are damaged. The player must build a new primary dam. 

Primary dam B / Support dam A \- Dam A is destroyed by the flood and dam B is slightly damaged. 

Primary dam B / Support dam C \- Dam B is severely damaged by the flood and dam C is unaffected.

Primary dam C / Support dam A \- Dam A and Dam C are destroyed by the flood

Primary dam C / Support dam B \- Dam B is severely damaged by the flood and dam C is unaffected.

Why are floods worse after wildfires dialogue

| Salmon: Oh it's you\! Please, I need your help\! |  |  |
| :---- | ----- | :---- |
| **Beaver**: What's wrong? |  | **Beaver:** Why are floods worse after wildfires? |
| **Salmon**: The stream's flow is way too fast, and it's causing a lot of problems for my people. Your dam helped to slow things down but the incoming flood could be very destructive for us\!  |  | **Salmon**: I can tell you what I know but please promise to help me\! |
| **Beaver**: How so? |  | **Beaver**: Ok |
| **Salmon**: After a wildfire there is usually flooding but these floods are worse than regular floods. I’m not sure why that’s the case but heavy floods erode the riverbed and pick up ash from the fire, making the water muddy and unsuitable for us. **Salmon**: You see, we salmon need cool, clean, oxygen-rich moving water to survive. |  | **Salmon**: The stream's flow is way too fast, and it's causing a lot of problems for my people. Your dam helped to slow things down but the incoming flood could be very destructive for us\! |
| **Beaver**: But what should I do? |  | **Beaver**: I think I have an idea. |
| **Salmon**: I’m not sure, but remember; water always finds another way forward. Maybe you can too. |  |  |

| Turtle: Hello there\! |
| :---- |
| **Beaver**: Why are floods worse after wildfires? |
| **Turtle**: I’m honestly not quite sure, but I do know that floods usually happen during spring when snowpack, which is an accumulation of snow that gradually compresses and then melts seasonally – begins to melt and run through the rivers and land.  |
| **Turtle:** It's an event called freshet, but if it's too hot the snow melts too early or too quickly and can cause damaging floods. |

| Jackrabbit: Howdy\! |
| :---- |
| **Beaver**: Why are floods worse after wildfires? |
| **Jackrabbit**: Hi beaver\! I couldn't paint the entire picture for you, but from my understanding wildfires burn the soil and vegetation, making the ground less permeable. Without any vegetation or soil to absorb it, water just runs off the land.  |

| Columbia Spotted Frog: Croak |  |
| :---- | ----- |
| **Beaver**: Why are floods worse after wildfires?  |  |
| **Columbia Spotted Frog**: Because Mother Nature’s too busy putting out fires to mop the floor\! |  |
| **Beaver**: lol |  |

Mosquito is located upstream

| Mosquito: Bzzzzz hello bzzzzz |  |  |  |
| :---- | :---- | ----- | :---- |
| **Beaver**: Hey |  |  | **Beaver**: Why are floods worse after wildfires?  |
| **Mosquito:** I’ve actually been meaning to talk to you |  |  | **Mosquito:** it’s nice to meet you too, I guess… |
| **Beaver**: What’s up?  |  |  | **Beaver**: Sorry, Hi |
| **Mosquito:** I heard that you’re an incredible engineer and could build useful things. |  |  | **Mosquito:** I’ve actually been meaning to talk to you |
| **Beaver**: I am pretty incredible. | **Beaver**: I try my best |  |  |
| **Mosquito:** You’re amazing\!  |  |  |  |
| **Mosquito:** I was wondering if you could do something to slow down the flow of water and make some shallow pools. I need calm, shallow water to breed and lay eggs. |  |  |  |
| **Beaver**: To be honest, I’m not sure if I want you to breed | **Beaver**: What do I get out of this? |  |  |
| **Mosquito:** Well, first of all I’m not the only animal that needs this. Other creatures like frogs need this sort of aquatic habitat to survive. |  |  |  |
| **Mosquito:** Also, by increasing our population you will introduce other animals like turtles, fish and birds that eat our species. |  |  |  |
| **Beaver**: Ok, I’ll see what I can do |  |  |  |

Field Notes: Floods

All items should be in one location

| Item | Description |
| :---- | :---- |
| Overflowing river banks and rain Logs in the river stabilizing banks Turbidity (muddy water) | **Causes**: Flooding is usually caused by a prolonged period of heavy rains. The excess water causes river and stream levels to rise, eventually spilling over their banks and flooding the surrounding land. In the Okanagan, flooding is also caused by freshet; the melting of snow in the mountains. |
| Burnt zone beside the stream with no vegetation Vegetation beside the stream Any area beside the stream | **Vertical and Lateral Movement:** Floods can be destructive if there is very little vegetation to absorb the water, but wetlands act as sponges by absorbing excess water in wetland soils and underground aquifers. As well as moving vertically (down into the ground), water also moves laterally, across the land. The area next to a river or stream that floods is called a floodplain. |
| A patch of mud near the stream The players canal Isolated water body  | **Erosion and Deposition**: Allowing water to move laterally allows sediment (sand, clay,organic matter, etc.) to settle in various areas, promoting the growth of vegetation. Beaver-made canals aid in this lateral spread by diverting water to other areas and connecting isolated water bodies. |
