| Dam Cattail Floodplain Isolated water bodies | **Ecosystem Services** A wetland is a land area where the soil is submerged or saturated with water, either permanently or seasonally. Wetlands offer several ecosystem services (benefits to humans) and play a crucial role in: Water purification  filtering pollutants and sediment. Groundwater recharge – allowing water to infiltrate into aquifers. Flood control – absorbing and slowing water flow. |
| Which aquatic plants do we have in the game? Cattails Black cottonwood Aspen Saskatoon Birch | **Wetland Plants** Wetlands support specialized vegetation that are water-tolerant (Hydrophytic) and help stabilize the ecosystem. **Submergent/Aquatic plants** normally grow entirely underwater but might have flowering parts floating or growing above the surface. **Emergent plants** are rooted in the soil of shallow water bodies, with leaves and stems rising above the surface. **Riparian** plants have evolved to tolerate both dry and wet conditions. They grow in drier areas with high water tables such as floodplains. |

Reward: ?

| Black Bear: Hello Beaver, thank you so much for all your hard work. |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Black Bear:** When you hear the word system, what does it remind you of? |  |
| **Beaver:** A process | **Beaver:** A machine |
| **Black Bear:** To me a system is a series of relationships, and an ecosystem is a series of relationships between living and non-living beings. |  |
| **Black Bear:** None of us can live apart from these relationships, from the smallest insects to the largest creatures. |  |
| **Black Bear:** For us to thrive, we must work together. Each of us has our strengths and roles. Our shared purpose lies in protecting our environment by respecting natural processes. |  |
| **Black Bear:** So thank you beaver for using your natural talents and abilities to restore our home. |  |

| Coyote: There’s our brilliant ecosystem engineer\! |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Coyote**:I’m truly grateful for your species. Your instinct to build dams has created wetlands that not only boost biodiversity but also replenish our groundwater. |  |
| **Coyote**: You create habitats or so many animals, including me. |  |
| **Coyote**: We are all a part of living networks, relationships between species, water, land, and climate. These intricate, interdependent systems are our relations, they sustain us. |  |

| King Salmon: Good day, Beaver\! |  |
| :---- | :---- |
| **King Salmon**: What a beautiful wetland you've created.  |  |
| **King Salmon**: A wetland is like a sponge, it soaks up water during heavy rain and slowly releases it over time |  |
| **King Salmon**: During times of drought our wetland plants stay moist, and during wildfires they don’t burn as easily. |  |
| **King Salmon**: Now imagine what a network of wetlands could do for the Okanagan? |  |
